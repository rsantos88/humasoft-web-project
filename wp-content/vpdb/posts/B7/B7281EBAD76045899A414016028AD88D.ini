<p>In the last experiments carried out, we've implemented a new uncoupled control, which solved the problems of the old coupled control. These problems originated as a consequence of the action of two independent controllers acting on the same variables. This supposes that the target given to the inclination controller, whose objective is to correct the inclination error only, gives rise to an action that interferes with the control in orientation, even causing an increase in the error to be corrected by the latter and giving rise to both controllers interfering with each other.<br>This behavior of the system means that the platform performs very slow and oscillating movements until finally reaching the reference position. In this way, the system finds a convergence between the instructions of both controllers, however, due to the competition they carry out between them, it is a slow process that also generates erroneous trajectories. The main solution proposed to solve this problem is to uncouple the orientation of the inclination to obtain the variation in length of each of the three threads to reach a position.</p>

<p>For this type of control it has been decided to dispense with the inverse kinematics equations and to propose a new model based entirely on the correction of the position using speed control actions. The controller will try to minimize the error in inclination and orientation, being fed back through the value obtained by the sensor.  The operation of the model is established for the triangular area that exists between two consecutive motors, and can be extrapolated to the remaining two areas. It has to be assumed that the inclination as the orientation of the platform in that area can be achieved with a combination of the cable winding of the two adjacent motors. Therefore, it can be considered for each of these motors that the variation in the length of the wire is made up of two components: one due to inclination, and the other due to orientation. If a pure incline is desired in the center of the area, both cables should be pulled and a similar reduction should result for both cables. If, on the other hand, it is desired to correct the orientation, causing a turn to the right, the right motor must reel in cable, while the left motor must release it with an antagonistic movement. The amount of cable to collect in each case is determined by the errors in inclination and orientation obtained through the IMU. Bellow, you can see a graphical comparison of the response that both controllers give in the Input Step Test, first in inclination and then in orientation.</p>
