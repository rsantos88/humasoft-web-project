<p>In this experiment, the new improved soft-neck model has been integrated into the humanoid robot TEO, incorporating the smaller <em>iPOS 3604Mx</em> drivers. For integration, a DCDC converter has been designed to convert the current voltage obtained by the 42v to 36v power supply, a voltage that we will use to power drivers and motors. A smaller <em>Arduino Nano</em> has been used to replace the previous <em>Arduino Mega</em> that was being used to publish the reading of the IMU sensor data. Finally, the 3 soft-neck drivers have been connected to the CAN network currently used by the right arm with <em>pcan2</em> port, allowing the reuse of the current CAN connector that connected to driver 28 of the front neck motor. After verifying that the communication was working correctly, we proceeded to perform the <em>Step Input Test</em>, using the <em>Decoupled Control</em> that we currently have implemented.</p>
