These soft links may be used interchangeably in various limbs of the humanoid robots, like arms, neck and spine, under the constraints of scalability, controllability of their stiffness and integration.</h3>

<p>Although advances in robotics have been undisputed for the past 50 years, robots made of rigid materials still have many limitations. Nowadays, there exists a new trend on biologically inspired robots with \"soft\" elements that are able to perform tasks which are not available to robots with rigid limbs. This new paradigm is known as Soft Robotics and is presented as an innovation beyond already existing flexible robots or other robots that include variable stiffness actuators (VSA). The technological challenge is in the incorporation of soft links into the robotic structure. This way, the MAR2016 (Multi-Annual Roadmap) of euRobotics remarks as one of the most important interdisciplinary challenges of modern robotics \"the design of soft robotics\".</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the case of humanoid robotics, and in comparison with a rigid design, a robot with soft links has the following main advantages:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>simplicity of design, favouring an underactuated architecture without the need of increasing the number of degrees of freedom.</li><li>increased accessibility and adaptability to complex environments, with a postural control that can hardly be implemented in rigid robots.</li><li>safer interaction with the human and the environment, with a high level of absorption of possible impacts, increasing the stability of the robot.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Currently, there are several international projects for the design and use of soft robots:<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true} -->
<ol><li>OCTOPUS (SSSA, Italy), devoted to the design of submarine soft robots with large manipulation capabilities</li><li>COMANOID (CNRS, France), for robot access to constrained spaces during assembly operations in the fuselage of an airplane 3) JUSTINew (DLR, Germany), for the improvement of the perception of a humanoid robot by the integration of a soft neck.</li><li>JUSTINew (DLR, Germany), for the improvement of the perception of a humanoid robot by the integration of a soft neck.</li></ol>

<p>The main objective of the HUMASoft project is the development of a new type of links to create softer humanoid robots that meet the characteristics of simplicity, accessibility and safety. These soft links may be used interchangeably in various limbs of the humanoid robots, like arms, neck and spine, under the constraints of scalability, controllability of their stiffness and integration. To achieve this goal, the project proposes the following subobjectives:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true} -->
<ol><li>design and development of a prototype of soft link with definition of its material and its actuation system. As a result the electromechanical prototype will be obtained with the premise of easy integration into the rigid structure of a humanoid robot.</li><li>reconfigurable embedded control system for the soft link, using fractional order and robust control techniques. As a result a controller easily implementable in TEO will be obtained</li><li>substitution (integration) of various links of the life-size humanoid robot TEO by soft links properly scaled to act like arms, neck and spine. As a result a new soft humanoid will be available</li><li>final evaluation of the system, developing new metrics for the analysis of the behaviour of the soft robot, especially in human-robot interaction.</li></ol>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This project is aligned with the Horizon 2020 Call ICT-2016 Work Programme, which specifically focuses on technological challenges for soft robotics related to manipulation, safety and interaction. These challenges represent a major innovation in traditional robotics and other emerging sectors.</p>
